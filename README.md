# 🎮 Real-Time Tic-Tac-Toe Over Two Servers

**Backend Developer Home Test - Real-time multiplayer game with distributed server architecture**

This project implements a real-time Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can connect to different WebSocket servers and play together, with game state synchronized via Redis pub/sub.

## 🏗️ Architecture and Communication Design

### System Architecture
```
CLI Client A ←→ Server A (3001) ←→ Redis Pub/Sub ←→ Server B (3002) ←→ CLI Client B
     ↓                                                                    ↓
   Player X                                                           Player O
```

**Key Components:**
- **Two Independent WebSocket Servers**: Running on ports 3001 and 3002
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: Real-time synchronization between servers
- **CLI WebSocket Clients**: Terminal-based game interface with ASCII board
- **Distributed Game State**: Consistent across both servers

### Communication Protocols

#### Client ↔ Server (WebSocket JSON Messages)
```json
// Join game
{ "type": "join", "playerId": "X" }

// Make move
{ "type": "move", "row": 1, "col": 2 }

// Game state update
{ "type": "update", "board": [["X","",""],["","O",""],["","",""]], "nextTurn": "X" }

// Game won
{ "type": "win", "winner": "O" }

// Draw condition
{ "type": "draw" }

// Invalid move
{ "type": "error", "message": "Invalid move: cell already occupied" }
```

#### Server ↔ Server (Redis Pub/Sub Sync)
```json
// State synchronization
{ "type": "stateUpdate", "gameState": {...}, "serverId": "server-3001" }

// Player events
{ "type": "playerJoin", "playerId": "X", "serverId": "server-3001" }
{ "type": "playerMove", "move": {...}, "serverId": "server-3001" }
```

## 🚀 Instructions to Run Both Servers

### Method 1: One-Click Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Start Redis + both servers automatically
.\scripts\start-game.bat
```

### Method 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Terminal 2 - Server A (Port 3001)
node src/enhancedServer.js 3001

# Terminal 3 - Server B (Port 3002)
node src/enhancedServer.js 3002
```

### Method 3: Docker Compose
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

## 🎮 Instructions to Run CLI Client(s)

### Interactive Launcher
```bash
# Choose server connection automatically
.\scripts\play-game.bat
```

### Direct Connection
```bash
# Connect to Server A
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3001

# Connect to Server B
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3002
```

## 🧪 How to Test 2-Player Game from Two Terminals

### Test 1: Same Server Connection
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Player X
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2 - Player O
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3001
```

### Test 2: Cross-Server Connection (Core Requirement)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Player X connects to Server A
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2 - Player O connects to Server B
node src/client.js ws://localhost:3002
```
**This demonstrates real-time synchronization between independent servers!**

### Test 3: Automated Validation
```bash
# Quick server connectivity test
node tests/quick-test.js

# Full game logic test suite
npm test
```
